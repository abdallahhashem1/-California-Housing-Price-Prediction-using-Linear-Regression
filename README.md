This repository contains a **Linear Regression project** on the California Housing dataset. The goal is to predict the **median house value** based on features such as location, number of rooms, household income, and proximity to the ocean.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Checking for missing values
  - Visualizing feature distributions with histograms
  - Scatter plots of features vs target
  - Correlation heatmaps

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Handling missing values
  - Encoding categorical features
  - Feature selection

- **Model Building:**
  - Splitting data into training and testing sets
  - Training a Linear Regression model
  - Evaluating model performance using MSE, MAE, and R²
  - Residual analysis and visualization

- **Prediction:**
  - Predicting house prices for new data points
  - Example provided for testing new houses

- **Visualization:**
  - True vs Predicted plots
  - Residual distribution plots

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
